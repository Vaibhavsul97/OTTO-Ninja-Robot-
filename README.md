🤖 OTTO Ninja Robot
The Biped Ninja Robot is a 3D-printed, bipedal robot with dual movement modes (walk & roll), obstacle detection, and remote control via Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module. Controlled through the RemoteXY mobile app, the robot offers interactive features and intelligent navigation.

🚀 Features
Wi-Fi Control: ESP8266-based, controlled using the RemoteXY app (iOS/Android).
Dual Movement Modes:
Walk Mode – Uses 180° servos for leg movement.
Roll Mode – Uses 360° servos for foot-based rolling.
Obstacle Detection: HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with auto-stop and rollback on object detection (<15 cm).
Custom 3D-Printed Body: Compact and lightweight design.
Powered by LiPo Battery: 7.4V 360mAh 2S Bonka battery.

⚙️ How It Works
Walking Mode (Mode 0): Alternating leg movement for bipedal locomotion.
Rolling Mode (Mode 1): Smooth foot-rolling using continuous rotation servos.
Auto-Stop: Robot halts and rolls back if obstacle detected within 15 cm.

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Check Wi-Fi connection and RemoteXY configuration.
Verify ultrasonic sensor wiring.
Confirm servo functionality and battery level.

✅ Conclusion
A fun, responsive biped robot you can walk, roll, and program! Ideal for hobbyists and students exploring robotics and IoT.
